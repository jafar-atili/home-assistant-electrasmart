Custom integrations to control [Electra Air](https://www.electra-air.co.il) devices with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)

Electra devices will be discovered after the `electrasmart` integration is configured

The configuration can be done via the frontend, the user must provide a valid phone number that registered with the [Electra Smart](https://www.electra-air.co.il/page/smart) app.

an OTP (One Time Password) will be generated and sent that phone number, provide this OTP in the config wizard and you should be good to go.
